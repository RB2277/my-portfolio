# My Portfolio

## Description

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is my own personal portfolio made using React as the basis. It features an about us homepage, a resume page, projects page, and contact page. All of these can be visited without the page reloading due to the use of Browser-router. Additionally the site features a header and footer made with React, and will persist no matter which page you are in.
